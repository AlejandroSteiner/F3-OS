# F3-OS MANIFESTO

## What is F3-OS?

**F3-OS is not a traditional operating system.**

F3-OS is a **cognitive experiment at the kernel level**. A system that preaches synthesis, feedback, and collective improvement, and therefore must be developed with cognitive diversity, not in isolation.

**F3-OS is also an autonomous system that acts as a "real clone of the user working in the user's matrix", capable of operating independently for at least a week without supervision.**

See [COMPLETE_VISION.md](COMPLETE_VISION.md) for the complete system vision.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Adaptive by Design

F3-OS is designed to adapt. It needs multiple perspectives, public criticism, and continuous evolution. It does not seek static stability, but progressive improvement.

### 2. Experimental by Nature

This project does not promise POSIX compatibility. It does not seek to replace Linux, Windows, or macOS. It is a laboratory of ideas about how an operating system can evolve through structural feedback.

### 3. Foundational, Not Proprietary

Great advances in operating systems and software architecture were not born closed. Unix, Linux, BSD, LLVM, Rust — all were built in community. F3-OS follows this principle.

---

## What F3-OS is NOT

### ❌ NOT a production operating system

Do not use F3-OS in critical environments. It is not designed for long-term stability. It is experimental.

### ❌ NOT seeking POSIX compatibility

F3-OS does not attempt to be compatible with Unix-like systems. It has its own execution model and resource management.

### ❌ NOT a "just because" project

Every change must have conceptual justification. We don't add features "because it would be cool". Everything must align with the F3 model.

### ❌ NOT a fork of another OS

F3-OS is an original architecture based on the 3-thread model (CPU/RAM/MEM) merged into an adaptive funnel.

---

## The F3 Model

F3-OS implements a unique resource management model:

### The 3 Fundamental Threads

1. **CPU Thread (Executor)**: Executes tasks, measures cycles, reports latencies
2. **RAM Thread (Context Keeper)**: Maintains states, creates snapshots, decides what to discard
3. **MEM Thread (Synthesizer)**: Semantic memory, summarizes patterns, provides feedback

### The Funnel (F3 Core)

The 3 threads converge in the F3 Core, which:
- Compresses state
- Generates structural feedback
- Dynamically modifies scheduling and memory

### The Adaptive Cycle

F3-OS operates in a continuous 4-phase cycle:

1. **LOGICAL**: Ordered, predictable, low entropy
2. **ILLOGICAL**: Intentional disorder, exploration, high entropy
3. **SYNTHESIS**: The funnel concentrates, reorganizes, entropy decreases
4. **PERFECT**: Optimized state, applies refined feedback

**This cycle repeats continuously, improving the system with each iteration.**

## Who F3-OS is For

### ✅ It's for you if:

- You're interested in experimentation in operating system architecture
- You want to understand how a kernel works from scratch
- You're passionate about adaptive feedback and self-improving systems
- You seek a project where every decision has conceptual justification
- You're willing to question and be questioned about technical decisions

### ❌ NOT for you if:

- You're looking for a stable operating system for production
- You need compatibility with existing software
- You prefer projects with clear roadmap and predefined features
- You're not interested in understanding the conceptual model before contributing
- You're looking for an "easy" or "quick to learn" project

---

## Project Philosophy

### The Fundamental Rule

**"Logical but illogical in its structure until it becomes logical and perfect again"**

This is not just a technical description. It is the philosophy that governs every decision in F3-OS.

### Synthesis, Not Average

The funnel does not average metrics. It synthesizes. Analyzes correlations. Extracts patterns from chaos.

### Inverse Feedback

The end of the cycle rewrites the beginning. The final state adjusts the initial rules. It's "reverse winding" — like winding 3 optical fiber threads into their cartridge in reverse.

### Continuous Evolution

Each cycle produces a system better than the previous one. There is no "final version". Only progressive improvement.

## Commitment to the Community

F3-OS is shared as open source because:

1. **It needs cognitive diversity**: A single point of view limits evolution
2. **Public criticism improves the project**: Ideas are strengthened when questioned
3. **Execution protects better than secrecy**: Ideas are not protected by hiding them, they are protected by executing them better

But this does not mean "anything goes". F3-OS has structure, rules, and a conceptual core that is carefully guarded.

---

## The Sacred Core

Not everything in F3-OS is democratic. There is a core that is guarded:

- **F3 Core**: The central funnel and its synthesis logic
- **The 3-thread model**: CPU, RAM, MEM as architectural structure
- **The phase cycle**: Logical → Illogical → Synthesis → Perfect
- **Inverse feedback**: How the end adjusts the beginning

These elements are not modified without deep discussion and solid conceptual justification.

---

## License and Use

F3-OS is licensed under **GPL-3.0**.

This means:
- You can use, modify, and distribute the code
- You must maintain the GPL-3.0 license in derivatives
- You must share the improvements you make

**But remember**: This is an experimental project. Use it at your own risk.

---

## Conclusion

F3-OS is an experiment. A laboratory of ideas about how an operating system can evolve through adaptive feedback.

It's not for everyone. And that's fine.

If you've made it this far and this resonates with you, welcome. If not, that's also fine. F3-OS does not seek to be popular. It seeks to be coherent with its own philosophy.

**The system must be logical but illogical in its structure until it becomes logical and perfect again.**

This is the manifesto. This is the vision. This is F3-OS.
