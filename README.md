**F3-OS** is an experimental open-source operating system based on an innovative model of **3 fundamental threads** that merge into a central **funnel**, creating an adaptive feedback flow that governs system scheduling, memory, and execution.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Read [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) before contributing. F3-OS is not a traditional operating system. It is a cognitive experiment at the kernel level with specific rules and philosophy.

## Governing AI Agent - GUI Interface

F3-OS includes a **specialized AI agent** that governs project development and acts as an interactive assistant for users. The interface features a futuristic Star Wars/Formula 1 style design.

*Assistant interface with agent life indicator (top right), real-time status panel, and interactive chat*

</div>

**Main features:**
- 🟢 **Agent Life Indicator**: Circular F1/Star Wars style clock with real-time active time
- 📊 **Status Panel**: Dynamic metrics (phase, entropy, perfection score, CPU)
- 💬 **Interactive Chat**: Real-time conversation with complete knowledge base
- 🎨 **Futuristic Theme**: Dark design with neon green accents and light effects
- 📚 **Immediate Resolution**: The agent has access to all project documentation

**Start the assistant:**
```bash
cd agent
./run.sh gui-server
# Open: http://localhost:8080
```

See [agent/README.md](agent/README.md) for more information.

## 🚀 Final Implementation Vision

F3-OS is designed as an **autonomous system that acts as a real clone of the user working in the user's matrix**, capable of operating independently for at least one week without supervision.

### Installation Flow from USB Drive

1. **USB Drive Connection**
   - When you connect a USB drive with F3-OS, the system requests assistant download
   - The assistant asks about your hardware and operating system
   - Installation occurs in a **second-layer emulator** (runs on top of your OS)

2. **Kernel Boot with Graphics**
   - After installation, the kernel boots with its graphics
   - Initial screen is displayed showing:
     - F3-OS logo
     - System status (phase, entropy, perfection score)
     - Assistant life indicator
     - Graphical interface ready for interaction

3. **Assistant Active and Listening**
   - The assistant is present and listening
   - You can ask it to do things like:
     - Open the web and search for a topic
     - Execute system tools
     - Manage files and directories
     - Interact with hardware through drivers
   - The assistant executes commands using all available tools

### Funnel System and Hardware Control

**The assistant works with F3-OS's funnel system:**
- Acts directly on any process in terms of hardware and pulse emission
- The funnel system (F3 Core) processes commands and controls hardware directly
- **Frequency-based optimization**: F3-OS drivers decode sub-channels of frequencies in metals (copper, gold, etc.)
- **Hardware optimization**: Uses available elements better through frequency analysis and sub-channel decoding
- **Integration of new rules**: The funnel integrates new rules based on frequency synthesis
- Continuously improves system efficiency through frequency-based feedback

### Civil Technology (No Credits)

**Fundamental principle: "Civil" = Accessible, no hidden costs**
- ✅ **No API credits consumed**: The assistant works completely locally
- ✅ **Open source**: Completely open code
- ✅ **No proprietary dependencies**: Only standard technologies
- ✅ **Accessible to everyone**: No subscriptions or payments required
- ✅ **Hardware improvement**: F3-OS improves user hardware with optimized drivers
- ✅ **Credit-free assistant**: Supports an assistant that doesn't consume credits

### Use Case: Autonomous Server

**Example: ktzchenWe3 on F3-OS Server**

When running a project like ktzchenWe3 on an F3-OS server:
- The server, with hardware consumption levels, invokes its own:
  - **Indexing** (search, cataloging)
  - **Social networks** (posts, interactions)
  - **Emails** (sending, receiving, organization)
  - **Updates** (system, dependencies, content)
- When you turn it on, F3-OS knows what rules to ask you so you can tell it what you want to do
- Everything operates according to defined rules and continuous learning

### Final Goal: Real User Clone

**Current objective for F3-OS**: To run autonomously being **in first person the user** to continue the task for **at least one week without supervision**. A real state of a **controlled alternate user**.

**Definition**: **"A real clone of the user working in the user's matrix"**

**Characteristics**:
- F3-OS acts as if it were the user
- Makes decisions as the user would
- Learns from user behavior
- Replicates work and thinking patterns
- Operates autonomously for extended periods
- Produces real results in the user's real environment

See [COMPLETE_VISION.md](COMPLETE_VISION.md) for the complete vision documentation.

## Main Concept

F3-OS is inspired by the graphic metaphor of **"winding 3 optical fiber threads into their cartridge in reverse"**, which technically translates to:

- **3 Fundamental Threads**: CPU (Executor), RAM (Context Keeper), MEM (Synthesizer)
- **Central Funnel (F3 Core)**: Receives, compresses, and synthesizes flows from the 3 threads
- **Inverse Backpropagation**: The final state rewrites previous decisions
- **Adaptive Cycle**: Logical → Illogical → Synthesis → Perfect

### The Physical Foundation

**The heart of F3-OS - the funnel of the 3 threads - is based on a real physical concept:**

The F3 Core is fundamentally a **frequency synthesizer** that:
- **Decodes sub-channels of frequencies** in metals (copper, gold, etc.)
- **Integrates new rules** through frequency analysis
- **Optimizes hardware** by understanding frequency characteristics in metallic conductors
- **Uses available elements better** because F3-OS drivers work at the frequency level

**F3-OS naturally uses available elements better because it implements F3-OS Drivers** - drivers that decode frequency sub-channels in metals and optimize hardware through frequency-based feedback.

See [F3_CORE_FOUNDATION.md](F3_CORE_FOUNDATION.md) for the complete foundation explanation.

## Architecture

### 3 Fundamental Threads

1. **CPU Thread (Executor)**
   - Executes tasks
   - Measures real cycles
   - Reports latencies

2. **RAM Thread (Context Keeper)**
   - Maintains partial states
   - Creates compressed snapshots
   - Decides what to discard

3. **MEM Thread (Synthesizer)**
   - Semantic memory
   - Summarizes patterns and results
   - Provides feedback

### F3 Core (Funnel)

The heart of the system that:
- Receives flows from the 3 threads
- Compresses state
- Generates structural feedback
- Dynamically modifies scheduling and memory

### System Phase Cycle

F3-OS operates in a 4-phase cycle:

1. **LOGICAL**: Ordered, predictable, low entropy
2. **ILLOGICAL**: Intentional disorder, exploration, high entropy
3. **SYNTHESIS**: The funnel concentrates, reorganizes, entropy decreases
4. **PERFECT**: Optimized state, applies refined feedback

This cycle repeats continuously, improving the system with each iteration.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- **Rust** (nightly): `rustup toolchain install nightly`
- **QEMU**: `sudo apt install -y qemu-system-x86`
- **GRUB**: `sudo apt install -y grub-pc-bin grub-common xorriso mtools`
- **LLVM/LLD**: `sudo apt install -y llvm lld`

Or install everything at once:
```bash
./INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.sh
```

### Compile

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will generate `kernel.bin` in the project root.

### Run

#### Option 1: Direct Boot (no ISO required)
```bash
./run.sh
```

#### Option 2: Bootable ISO (more compatible)
```bash
# Create ISO
./create_grub_iso.sh

# Run ISO
./run_iso.sh
```

## 🔬 Development

### Compile the Kernel

```bash
cd /home/ktzchen/Documentos/f3-os
./build.sh
```

The kernel compiles for the `x86_64-unknown-none` target using Rust nightly and `build-std`.

### Run in QEMU

```bash
# Direct boot (requires Multiboot header)
./run.sh

# From ISO (requires creating ISO first)
./create_grub_iso.sh
./run_iso.sh
```

### Debugging

For debugging in QEMU:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -cdrom f3os.iso \
  -display gtk \
  -m 256M \
  -no-reboot \
  -serial stdio \
  -s -S  # To connect with GDB
```

## 📝 Fundamental System Rule

**"Logical but illogical in its structure until it becomes logical and perfect again"**

This rule is implemented as the system's phase cycle:
1. Starts ordered and predictable (LOGICAL)
2. Introduces intentional disorder to explore (ILLOGICAL)
3. The funnel synthesizes and reorganizes (SYNTHESIS)
4. The system optimizes and returns to improved order (PERFECT)

This cycle repeats continuously, improving the system with each iteration.
